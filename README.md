# weather-dashboard

- The Weather Dashboard is created using the Open Weather Map API (https://openweathermap.org/api)

- Along with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Moment.JS, and Jquery

- The Weather Dashboard is a dynamic web application that provides user with weather information about a searched city

- Upon searching for a city the page will display the weather representing the current day

- It will also display a forecast for the next 5 days. Which is styled using Bootstrap classes

- Underneath the search form is a div element that stores your search history and displays them as buttons

- When these buttons are clicked whatever was on the page will be changed to that cities weather forecast

- This application helped solidify a lot of different concepts for myself but especially made me a lot more comfortable using API calls and accesing/passing the information

-This application is deployed at: https://chesebro11.github.io/weather-dashboard/
